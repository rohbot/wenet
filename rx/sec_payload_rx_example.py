#   Example reception of some basic 'Secondary Payload' packets.
#   This is a method by which another process or payload can inject data into
#   the Wenet downlink telemetry channel. This script listens for packets
#   emitted by the wenet receive process via UDP, and parses the 'sub-payload' telemetry.
#   
#   Refer to the equivalent sec_payload_tx_example in wenet/tx/examples/
#   for how to send packets from a payload.
#
#   This script requires that a Wenet receiver be running.
#   i.e. start one using the start_rx.sh script.
