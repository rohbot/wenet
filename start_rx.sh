#	Wenet RX-side Initialisation Script
#	2018-12-20 Mark Jessop <vk5qi@rfhead.net>
#
#	This code mostly assumes an RTLSDR will be used for RX.
#	For the lower rate variants (4800/9600), GQRX could be used.

# Wenet Transmission Centre Frequency:

# Default Wenet Frequency, as used on most Project Horus flights.
RXFREQ=441200000
# Secondary downlink frequency, used on dual-launch flights
#RXFREQ=443500000

# Receiver Gain. Set this to 0 to use automatic gain control, otherwise if running a
# preamplifier, you may want to experiment with different gain settings to optimize
# your receiver setup.
# You can find what gain range is valid for your RTLSDR by running: rtl_test
GAIN=0

# Bias Tee Enable (1) or Disable (0)
BIAS=0
# Note that this will need the rtl_biast utility available, which means
# building the rtl-sdr utils from this repo: https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr


# Change the following path as appropriate.
# If running this from a .desktop file, you may need to set an absolute path here
# i.e. /home/username/wenet/rx/
cd ~/wenet/rx/




# Receive Flow Type:
# IQ = Pass complex samples into the fsk demodulator. (Default)
#      This is suitable for use with RTLSDRs that do not have DC bias issues.
#      Examples: RTLSDR-Blog v3 Dongles. (anything with a R820T or R820T2 tuner)
#
# SSB = Demodulate the IQ from the SDR as a very wide (400 kHz) USB signal, and
#       pass that into the fsk demodulator.
#       This is useful when the RTLSDR has a DC bias that may affect demodulation.
#		i.e. RTLSDRs with Elonics E4000 or FitiPower FC0013 tuners.
#		Note: This requires that the csdr utility be installed: https://github.com/simonyiszk/csdr.git
#
# GQRX = Take USB audio from GQRX, via a UDP stream on port 7355.
#		 This assumes that GQRX has been set into 'wide' (24 kHz BW) USB mode, and is 
#		 streaming samples to UDP:localhost:7355.
#		 Note 1: This mode will only work for low baud rates (~4800-9600 baud),
#		 that can fit within a ~20 kHz passband. The baud rate must also be an integer divisor of 48 khz.
#		 Note 2: When in this mode, all the frequency/gain/bias commands above will be ignored, as GQRX
#		 has control over the SDR.
